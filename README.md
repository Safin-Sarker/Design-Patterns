# Design-Patterns

## DesignPatternExamples

This repository contains practical examples of commonly used design patterns in software development. Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring design problems, making code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain. Here, you'll find implementations of the following design patterns:

- Singleton Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Abstract Factory Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Prototype Pattern

## Introduction

Design patterns provide a structured approach to solving common software design problems. They are templates that can be adapted to suit the specific needs of your project, promoting code reuse and best practices.

This repository aims to provide clear and concise examples of each pattern, demonstrating their implementation and usage in various scenarios.

## Patterns Included

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.



### Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. It promotes loose coupling by reducing the need for the client to know the specific class being instantiated.


### Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is useful for systems that need to be independent of how their objects are created.


### Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It is useful for creating objects with multiple configurations.


### Prototype Pattern

The Prototype Pattern creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. It is useful when the cost of creating a new object is more expensive than cloning an existing one.
